# Tensorflow.

Good afternoon, Tomas
My name is Ana. I'm reading your "Machine learning using Tensorflow" documentation. It is really what I was looking for: clear and well-written so I would like to know if your repositories could be available again. I don't know when you wrote this but It would be really usefull for me and my future work.
Thanks in advance for your time.
